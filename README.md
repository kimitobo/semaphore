### Sensor Semaphore

Sensor Semaphore is a prototype of a DIY wireless marine sensor and flag-semaphore for visualising the environmental data of the Baltic Sea. The sensor part of the prototype is a solar-powered, floating sea buoy, transmitting air and water temperature sensor values wirelessly to a receiver on nearby coast. The receiver is connected to a small scale model of a flag-semaphore, which signals the changes in data with the positions of the flags.

The project was completed during "Sensing the Baltic sea" maritime art & science -residency in Finnish archipelago in "HackLab @sea" sessions as part of M.A.R.I.N project in summer of 2011. Part of the methodology of the residency was to operate on off-the-grid environment in camps on small islands, engaging in discussions with a group of artists in residence around the topic of marine ecology and creative practices and doing the prototyping on-location.
