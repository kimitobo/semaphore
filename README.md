### Sensor Semaphore

Sensor Semaphore is a prototype of a DIY wireless marine sensor and flag-semaphore for visualising the environmental data of the Baltic Sea. The sensor part of the prototype is a solar-powered, floating sea buoy, transmitting air and water temperature sensor values wirelessly to a receiver on nearby coast. The receiver is connected to a small scale model of a flag-semaphore, which signals the changes in data with the positions of the flags.

The project was completed during "Sensing the Baltic sea" art & science -residency in Finnish archipelago in "HackLab @sea" sessions as part of M.A.R.I.N project in summer of 2011. Part of the methodology of the residency was to operate on off-the-grid environment in camps on small islands, engaging in discussions with a group of artists in residence around the topic of marine ecology and creative practices and doing the prototyping on-location.


### Information physicalisation workshop

Information visualisation is a method for understanding abstract data using graphical representation. Most often this is done via printed graphs and charts or as animations on a computer screen. With some creative use of microcontrollers and servo motors and other actuators, we can make physical and kinetic represntations of chosen data. Maybe even understand changes over time in the data better. In this workshop, we will do few experiments with environmental data translated to motion and make a kinetic sculpture that will perform infromation physicalisation for us.
